# Minesweeper

This is a replica of the game Minesweeper made in Java & Processing.

I used the processing IDE to make this project (for no real reason).  
I'm especially proud of this project because I personally got hooked on playing it xD


## How to Install and Run the Project

* Download and install [processing](https://processing.org/download).
* Download the ZIP file for the project from my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/oren9561/Minesweeper).  
* Launch the game and play
* If you want to review the code, launch the sketch through processing.
## How to play the game
### Keys

* Use the LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON to uncover tiles.
* Use the RIGHT_MOUSE_BUTTON to place a flagtiles.
* Press the smiley button to restart the game at any point
* If there's an uncovered tile with a number of flags - similar to the number on the tile - next to the tile itself, the user can press said tile to uncover all neighboring tiles other than the ones that have been flagged.

### How the game works

First, you pick a difficulty in the top right of the window. The harder the difficulty the bigger the amount of mines.
Each uncovered tile (that is not a mine) displays a number - that number is the amount of mines adjacent to this tile.
Your job is to uncover all the tiles on the screen without landing on a mine. You can do that by deducing which tiles contain mines and which don't using the numbers on the tiles.
You can flag tiles you think contain mines by right clicking them.

The win condition is to uncover all of the tiles without hitting a single mine.  
There's also a timer in the top left of the window to act as your score.

## Notes
* EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE
